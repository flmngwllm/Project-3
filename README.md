# Project 3
# Game List and Search

#### For my project I decided to have users create a list based on the games they choose and implement an api to get a collection of games. My struggle for this particular project was trying to get the api to work on the backend. I ran into a problem where cors access was not allowed while trying to run IGDB api on the front end. I was not able to get the api to run in the time alotted but I was able to learn a ewalth of information on api's in general.
